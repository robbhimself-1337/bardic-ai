As you crest the final hill, the coastal town spreads before you - a cluster of buildings nestled between the bay and the forest's edge. But something is wrong. The streets are quiet, shutters are drawn, and worried faces peer from windows. The cheerful warmth you expected from the famous Rusty Dragon Tavern feels muted, replaced by an atmosphere of fear and suspicion.",
